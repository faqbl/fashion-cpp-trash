A four-in-a-row(similar to gobang) ruled by gravity law and playing in the 6Ã—6 chessboard written in LC-3.
To simplified the work,I upload the cpp ver. code here and I will upload the LC-3 ver. code in another repository later.
Update:The filename should be the same as this readme but I forget to change it,so it's now named chess.cpp.2025-07-20 18:38:33
